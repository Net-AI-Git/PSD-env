"""
Standalone script to load a complex MATLAB (.mat) file containing multiple
PSD measurements, process them, and save them as individual .txt files.

This script performs the following actions:
1.  Loads a specific .mat file using scipy.
2.  Parses the MATLAB struct to extract a common frequency vector and a list
    of individual PSD measurements.
3.  Iterates through each measurement, extracting its name and PSD values.
4.  Filters the data to keep only the frequency range between 5 and 2000 Hz.
5.  Saves each filtered measurement into a separate .txt file, named after
    the measurement's identifier (e.g., 'A10X.txt').
6.  Plots the first processed measurement for visual verification.
